Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the testing of the Register and Login functionalities using the Page Object Model (POM) with Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. It includes both manual and automated test cases along with a video demonstration.

Project Structure

The project follows a structured POM (Page Object Model) approach and includes the following packages inside src/test/java/:

src/test/java/
  â”œâ”€â”€ PageObjects/            # Contains Page Object classes (LoginPage, RegisterPage, etc.)
  â”œâ”€â”€ TestCases/              # Contains test cases implementing TestNG
  â”œâ”€â”€ TestBase/               # Contains base classes for setup and configurations

Manual Testing

A set of manual test cases were created to validate the Register and Login functionalities. These test cases include various scenarios such as:

* Valid and invalid registration attempts

* Login with correct and incorrect credentials

* Error message validation for missing or incorrect inputs

Automation Testing

I.The automation script is built using:

II.Selenium WebDriver for UI interactions

III.TestNG for test execution

IV.Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability

V.Maven for dependency management and execution

VI.Assertions to validate expected results

Video Demonstration

A full walkthrough of the project, including test execution, is available in the following video:
